Inspired to some extent by [the kofi method](https://www.asiteaboutnothing.net/w_kofi-french.php) and also my own frustration with remembering conjugations.

The idea is to use SRS to drill all conjugations for a small set of representative verbs, here I've selected 10 verbs, covering each regular conjugation, a regular conjugation with stem change, a mixed conjugation, and four extremely common irregular verbs. 

Hopefully, upon completing this deck, you should be able to conjugate a good number latin verbs.
